Mapping artists of Last.fm to DBpedia
=======================
The hetrec2011-lastfm-2k dataset is released in the framework of the 2nd International Workshop on Information Heterogeneity and Fusion in Recommender Systems [HetRec 2011](http://ir.ii.uam.es/hetrec2011)
at the 5th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems [RecSys 2011](http://recsys.acm.org/2011) 

If you use the hetrec2011-lastfm-2k dataset please refer to:  
   http://ir.ii.uam.es/hetrec2011/datasets/lastfm/readme.txt  

The mapping files are formatted one entry per line as follows (tab separated, "\t"):  
artist_id	artist_name	DBpedia_URI  
An example of mapping is the following:  
1934	Adele	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adele  

Version 1.2
=======================
This version is an improvement of the version 1.1, which contained some redirect links. 
We replaced those links with the actual ones. When a link redicted to a disambiguation page, we selected the correct link among the different redirects in that page.
The number of matched artists is the same of version 1.1, namely 11,180.

Version 1.1
=======================

We used [DBpedia Lookup](https://github.com/dbpedia/lookup) to map each artist in the dataset with the corrisponding DBpedia resource (DBpedia 2015), using as QueryClass filter dbpedia-owl:Band and dbpedia-owl:MusicalArtist. We also implemented other filters to reduce the number of false positives in the final mapping. Finally, we manually checked all suspicious entities, if any, referenced by more than one dataset entry. For more detail about this procedure, see the references.
We found a match for 11,180 out of a total of 17,632 artists.

Version 1
=======================

The file contains the mappings between the artists in the hetrec2011-lastfm-2k dataset to the correspondent DBpedia resources (DBpedia v3.9). 

We did not find a mapping for all the artists in hetrec2011-lastfm-2k. We found a valid mapping for 8175 of them.
