Mapping books of LibraryThing to DBpedia
=======================
[LibraryThing dataset](http://www.macle.nl/tud/LT) is a rating dataset of books extracted from [LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com). 
    
The mapping files are formatted one entry per line as follows (tab separated, "\t"):  
book_id	book_title	DBpedia_URI  
An example of mapping is the following:  
3123767	The Da Vinci Code	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Da_Vinci_Code  

Version 1.2
=======================
This version is an improvement of the version 1.1, which contained some redirect links. 
We replaced those links with the actual ones. When a link redicted to a disambiguation page, we selected the correct link among the different redirects in that page.
The number of matched artists is the same of version 1.1, namely 11,694.

Version 1.1
=======================

We used [DBpedia Lookup](https://github.com/dbpedia/lookup) to map each book in the dataset with the corrisponding DBpedia resource (DBpedia 2015), using as QueryClass filter dbpedia-owl:Book. We also implemented other filters to reduce the number of false positives in the final mapping. Finally, we manually checked all suspicious entities, if any, referenced by more than one dataset entry. For more detail about this procedure, see the references.
We found a match for 11,694 out of a total of 37,231 books.

Version 1
=======================

This file contains the mappings between the books in the [LibraryThing dataset](http://www.macle.nl/tud/LT) to the correspondent DBpedia resources (DBpedia v3.9). 

We did not find a mapping for all the books in the dataset. We found a valid mapping for 8170 of them.
