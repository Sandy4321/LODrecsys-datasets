Mapping artists of MovieLens1M to DBpedia
=======================
The MovieLens1M dataset is published by GroupLeans research group (http://www.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

The mapping files are formatted one entry per line as follows (tab separated, "\t"):  
ML_id	ML_name	DBpedia_URI  
An example of mapping is the following:  
858	Godfather, The (1972)	http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Godfather   


Version 1.2
=======================
This version is an improvement of the version 1.1, which contained some redirect links. 
We replaced those links with the actual ones. When a link redicted to a disambiguation page, we selected the correct link among the different redirects in that page.
The number of matched movies is the same of version 1.1, namely 3,300.

Version 1.1
=======================

We used [DBpedia Lookup](https://github.com/dbpedia/lookup) to map each artist in the dataset with the corrisponding DBpedia resource (DBpedia 2015), using as QueryClass filter dbpedia-owl:Band and dbpedia-owl:MusicalArtist. We also implemented other filters to reduce the number of false positives in the final mapping. Finally, we manually checked all suspicious entities, if any, referenced by more than one dataset entry. For more detail about this procedure, see the references.
We found a match for 3,300 out of a total of 3,883 movies.

Version 1
=======================

This file contains the mappings between the movies in the MovieLens1M dataset to the correspondent DBpedia resources (DBpedia v3.9). 

	
We did not find a mapping for all the movies in MovieLens1M. We found a valid mapping for 3156 of them.
